# Q-With-Me on Render.

The app requires a staff ID to sign and use the app as a staff member and a patient ID as well as the ID of the staff member for which the patient has an appointment to sign in a patient. In a retail app these IDs might be entered into the machine via a magnetic card or the like.

As such, this app doesn't allow us to generate or determine these IDs. The following IDs are available for use when signing in.

## Staff

| ID  | Position  |
| --- | --------- |
| 9   | Doctor    |
| 10  | Doctor    |
| 11  | Doctor    |
| 12  | Nurse     |
| 13  | Secretary |
| 14  | Secretary |

## Patients

| Id  | Primary service provider |
| --- | ------------------------ |
| 4   | 9                        |
| 5   | 10                       |
| 6   | 11                       |
| 7   | 11                       |
| 8   | 11                       |
| 9   | 11                       |
